## Overview

This repository is a showcase of my various Java projects, developed over several years. Each project serves as a standalone example of specific Java concepts, frameworks, or technologies. This organization allows for easy access and reference for further development, learning, or sharing with others.

## Project List

### Core Java Fundamentals
Projects focused on mastering Java's core language features:
- **Java Basics and OOP**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and interfaces.
- **Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions, try-catch-finally blocks, and resource management.
- **File I/O**: Reading and writing files, working with streams, and handling different file formats.

### Data Structures and Algorithms
Projects demonstrating my understanding of data structures and algorithms:
- **Data Structures**: Lists, stacks, queues, hash maps, binary trees, and graphs.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort), searching (e.g., binary search), and graph traversal (e.g., DFS, BFS).
- **Design Patterns**: Examples like Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy for flexible code design.

### Desktop Applications
GUI projects using Swing, JavaFX, or other frameworks:
- **Simple Calculator**: A GUI-based calculator application.
- **To-Do List Manager**: Task management app with CRUD functionality.
- **Inventory Management System**: System for managing products, categories, and stock using a local database.

### Web Applications and Services
Projects showcasing server-side programming, web services, and APIs:
- **Java Servlets and JSP**: Dynamic content rendering with Java Servlets and JSP.
- **Spring Boot REST API**: RESTful API for handling requests and returning JSON responses.
- **E-commerce Platform**: Shopping cart app with user authentication, product catalog, and order processing.

### Enterprise and Database Integration
Projects demonstrating Javaâ€™s use in enterprise-level applications and database interaction:
- **Hibernate ORM**: Database persistence with Hibernate.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Data access layer implementation with complex queries.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular application design with inter-service communication.

### Miscellaneous Projects
Additional projects covering a range of Java skills:
- **Socket Programming**: Client-server communication with a basic chat application.
- **Multithreading and Concurrency**: Thread management, synchronization, and concurrent collections.
- **Testing with JUnit**: Unit tests for various classes, methods, and modules.

## Technologies and Libraries

Key technologies and tools include:
- **Java Versions**: Java 8, 11, and 17.
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, Hibernate, JavaFX, Swing.
- **Build Tools**: Maven, Gradle.
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite.
- **Testing**: JUnit, Mockito.
- **Version Control**: Git.
